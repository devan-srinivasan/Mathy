# Mathy
Fun math game built on Unity. Play with friends on your network!
This project is available on Google Play listed under the name Times! made by Sushi.inc (the name my friend and I used)
It is a two player math game that uses multiplication times tables to fill out squares. The first to get 5 in a row (like connect four) wins.

We used C# and a library called Mirror to network the game.

Built with my good friend Ali: github.com/YaySushi
